# Posh-Photo-Utils

This on-going project consists of a set of bespoke utilities I've created for a photographer to  improve her file management and processing workflows.

Future utilities in this area will be added to this project, as well as improvements / fixes to existing ones.

These utilities are open for use to everyone - but please note that you will be using them under your sole responsibility and at your own discretion.

At this time, they have only been tested on Windows 7 64bit and Windows 10 64bit,
and may work properly only using Powershell version 4.0 or above. 

Please feel free to get in touch if you have any comments, requests etc...
